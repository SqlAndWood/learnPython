   ENSURE YOU SELECT 'Install for All Users' as this will install Python to C:\Program Files\PythonXX

	Should you use Virtual Environment, you 'Deactivate' the Environment from teh command prompt: Deactivate.bat
	This is how you get Jupyter Notebook access to the entire HDD of C:\
	C:\VirtualEnvironments\ve\Scripts\Jupyter notebook   <-- ie run from C:\ and call the command 'Jupyter notebook'.

Python installation path: 

AW 14 Nov 2019: I used Python Ver 3.7 for the following , as Ver 3.8 has a lot of incompatibilities, which in turn returned too many errors to fix.

C:\%userprofile%\appdata

Note, the below is referenced at: https://jupyter.org/install.html

pip is a recursive acronym for "Pip Installs Packages"; is a de facto standard package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. 

1. Ensure Python (latest version) is installed

2. If necessary, upgrade Python pip with the following command (from the command prompt, located in the appropriate Python folder):
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      
3. Install Jupyter lab with the following command (from command prompt, in python\scripts folder):
      python -m pip install jupyterlab
      python -m pip install jupyter
      

5. Execute jupyter notebook
      jupyter notebook
      

6. Install the following

      pip install --upgrade setuptools
      
      pip install pandas
         Note that Pandus comes with the followign two, however run them seperately just to ensure latest version.
         pip install numpy
         pip install pytx
         
      pip install OpenPyXL    (read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm files)
         
      pip install scipy
      pip install matplotlib
      
      pip install xlrd        (Read Excel Data)
      pip install xlwt        (Write as Excel)
      pip install XlsxWriter  (Write file with xlsx extention )
      
      pip install geos
         Note that geos comes with the followign two, however run them seperately just to ensure latest version.
         pip install pillow
         pip install lxml
  
  
   
  
      pip install ez_setup
      
      
      
The following are for debugging, recommended by Raymond 
	pip install pyflakes    ## pyflakes filename.py
	pip install coverage	    # https://pypi.org/project/coverage/
	pip install mypy
	pip install pytest	##https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
	  (no longer supported) pip install doctests ##https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html
	pip install xdoctest
